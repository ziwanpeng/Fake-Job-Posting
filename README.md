As a data scientist in an online job posting service company, I am required to develop a model to identify the fake job posting because fake job postings may lead to some form of identity theft or user reduction due to low credibility of the job postings in our website. That is to say, more fake job postings may cause lower user activity even churns so that the company will meet financial problems like revenue decrease. Along with model development, I also need to construct a profile of what factors will indicate the fraudulent job postings to improve our service. Also, because the data set includes lots of text information such as job description and company profile, we should be careful to deal with text analysis when it comes to feature engineering step.
